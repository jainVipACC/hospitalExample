The solution highlights:

- clear relationship between hospital and patients
- solution is scalable, so tomorrow if we have to add more attributes to a patient like the department, diagnosis etc
we know where to add what and also add relevant filters.
- using collections for filtering patients for our requirement
- currently data is being created in a java class, can also be moved to a separate json/csv data file
- using Builder pattern to create patients
